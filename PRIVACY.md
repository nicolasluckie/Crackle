## Children's Privacy

Crackle does not collect personal information from anyone, including children.

The word list used in Crackle was sourced from an [open-source dataset of valid Wordle words](https://gist.github.com/dracos/dd0668f281e685bad51479e5acaadb93) (14,854 words). To ensure the application remains family-friendly, we filtered out inappropriate words by cross-referencing with a [profanity word list](https://github.com/coffee-and-fun/google-profanity-words/blob/main/data/en.txt), removing 53 words.

The final word list contains 14,801 appropriate 5-letter words suitable for all ages.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date. Continued use of the application after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
